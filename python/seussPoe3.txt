In a land not so far away,
Lived a man by the name of Edgar Poe,
He wrote tales of mystery,
And poetry that made folks feel eerie.

He was born in the city of Poe,
And grew up to be quite a poet, you know,
He wrote of death and loss,
And the darkness that it caused.

He wrote of a raven that nevermore spoke,
And a man trapped in a tell-tale heart,
His words were dark and somber,
But they always left an impression on the reader.

He wrote of an unnamed narrator,
Who dug up his own buried terror,
Of a man who loved a dead woman,
And a king who went mad with power.

He wrote of the Red Death and the masquerade,
And of a man who couldn't escape his own mind,
His stories were strange and eerie,
But they always stayed on people's mind.

But alas, poor Edgar's life was cut short,
At the young age of forty,
Though his tales live on forevermore,
In the hearts and minds of all who adore.
