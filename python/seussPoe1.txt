Once upon a time, in Baltimore city
Lived a man with a name so witty
Edgar Allen Poe, with a name so grand
Wrote tales of mystery, horror, and command.

He wrote of a Raven that perched on a door
Whose "Nevermore" echoed forevermore
He wrote of a Tell-Tale Heart that beat so fast
That the guilt of murder couldn't outlast.

He wrote of a Fall, a descent into madness
Of a mind consumed by its own sadness
He wrote of a Black Cat, with eyes so green
That haunted its owner, so serene

His stories, so dark and so eerie
Captivated readers, both near and leery
His legacy lives on, to this very day
In the hearts of all, who his words convey

So if you ever find yourself in Baltimore
Don't forget to pay homage to Edgar
For his tales, they will thrill, and they will scare
And take you on a journey beyond compare.
