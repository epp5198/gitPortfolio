Once upon a time, in a land not far away
There lived a man with a dark and twisted mind, they say
His name was Edgar Allen Poe, and he wrote with a quill
Tales of mystery and horror that gave folks a chill

He wrote of ravens and murders, of love and of loss
His words were a puzzle, with meanings at a cost
He wrote of a man in a pit, with a pendulum's swing
And a tell-tale heart that still makes readers shiver and cling

He was a master of words, a poet so divine
His stories were dark, but his language so fine
He wrote of the Red Death, and the Masque of the Red Death
He wrote of a man buried alive, with his final breath

He wrote of a man who could never forget
A love that he lost, and a debt he couldn't pay yet
He wrote of a city, so dark and so dreary
Where the streets were all muddy and the people were weary

He wrote of a world, where the dead walked around
And the living were buried, never to be found
He wrote of a dream, where the dreamer was trapped
And the only escape was a never-ending nap

His tales were strange, and his poetry deep
But his words were alive, and his stories still leap
From the pages of his books, to haunt us today
The legacy of Edgar Allen Poe, will never fade away
