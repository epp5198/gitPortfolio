        <h1>Reflection of Two Websites</h1>
        <button type="button">Click</button>
        <p>After creating two websites, one each through: PSU Wordpress and GitHub Pages, it had
            become apparent to me which website I preferred very early into the process. While using
            GitHub Pages though much more work and easily more difficult to create a website with
            than using Wordpress GitHub pages allows the user a broader horizon of creativity and
            uniqueness while building said website. While using Wordpress the user is given a very
            simplistic base to build upon whereas with GitHub pages everything is made from scratch
            allowing the website to be built to one's specifications.</p>
        <br />
        <p> Using both Wordpress and GitHub Pages came with challenges for new learners, but on
            separate levels. With Wordpress there is not a true ability to change every aspect of
            the website that is desired by the user. With Wordpress being a fairly simple
            application to use, the lack of actual website development involved is the most
            challenging part. While using GitHub Pages to create a website the user needs to code
            the website from scratch. This is a challenge for new users as there is a need to learn
            HTML coding along with its rules making it a more difficult application to use than
            Wordpress.</p>
        <br />
        <p> Both website building methods had their own separate advantages that the other did not.
            While building a website through Wordpress you are given a template along with very
            simplistic methods of entering information this makes setting up the website very simple
            as everything that is needed for the website to run is already there. The advantage of
            using GitHub Pages is very self explanatory as the user has the ability to make each
            aspect of their website to their liking allowing for much more influence on how the
            website looks.</p>
        <br />
        <p> Using Wordpress to create a website modifying the layout and organization is somewhat
            difficult, following the theme of it being a very basic website building tool. With the
            simplicity of building a website comes trouble in the way of organizing the website
            exactly how you want it. The limitations on what you can and cannot do are set making it
            somewhat troubling to organize the website. While using GitHub Pages the most troubling
            aspect of modifying the layout is having the knowledge of how to make the changes that
            you want to make it easier to achieve the desired layout while also making it a longer
            process.</p>
        <br />
        <p> For using each of these sights different skill sets are needed. While developing a
            website through Wordpress organization skills are very important for setting up the
            website and making it as user friendly as possible. In developing a website through
            GitHub Pages it is necessary to have the skills to correctly organize the website as
            well as the ability to understand what coding information each individual page or action
            needs to make the website run more effectively and display the desired information.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the event that I continue using my wordpress website I hope to learn how to better
            control the website and hope that there is more ability to customize the website than I
            have noticed as of now. Using GitHub Pages has been much more interesting in my mind and
            I hope to gain better skills in typing as well as remembering which elements and
            attributes do what to help develop my website more efficiently as I continue to work on
            it further.</p>
