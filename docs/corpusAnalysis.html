        <h1>Corpus Analysis</h1>
        <p>For my Corpus Analysis I have chosen to look between the inaugural addresses of<br> 
           our very first and most recent presidents, George Washington and Joe Biden.<p>
        <img src="pics/biden1.png" alt="Screenshot of Biden's inaugural address in voyant" width="600" height="300"/>
        <img src="pics/washington1.png" alt="Screenshot of Washingtons inaugural address in voyant" width="600" height="300"/>
        <br>
        
        <img src="pics/bidenNgram.png" alt="Photo of Biden Ngram"/>
        <img src="pics/washington2.png" alt="Photo of Washington Ngram"/>
        <p>The two images that can be seen above are the results of the most common two word ngram<br>
           clusters found in Joe Biden (left) and George Washington’s (right) Inaugural Addresses.<br>
           In President Biden's Inaugural Address the most common two words together are “we can” used<br>
           a total of fifteen times together. The most commonly used two words together from President<br>
           Washington’s Inaugural Address is “of the” used a total of 20 times. From looking at these two<br>
           images it can be clearly seen that both sets of text are related in some sort of way as both show<br>
           one seeming to take responsibility for their country.<p>
