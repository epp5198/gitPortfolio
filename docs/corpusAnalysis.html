        <h1>Corpus Analysis</h1>
        <p>For my Corpus Analysis I have chosen to look between the inaugural addresses of<br> 
           our very first and most recent presidents, George Washington and Joe Biden.<p>
        <img src="pics/biden1.png" alt="Screenshot of Biden's inaugural address in voyant" width="600" height="300"/>
        <img src="pics/washington1.png" alt="Screenshot of Washingtons inaugural address in voyant" width="600" height="300"/>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout President Biden’s (top) Inaugural Address the most commonly used word is America.<br>
           When viewing President Washington’s (bottom) Inaugural Address the most common word used was “government”.<br>
           To a blind eye just seeing these two images it may be difficult to tell that these texts regard the same<br>
           topic while only viewing the most commonly used words. As you begin to dive deeper into the information<br>
           with the Voyant and AntConc softwares it becomes more clear as to what the texts are and show a much more<br>
           in depth view of the two addresses.<p>

        <img src="pics/washington2.png" alt="Photo of Washington Ngram"/>
        <p>The two images that can be seen above are the results of the most common two word ngram<br>
           clusters found in Joe Biden (left) and George Washington’s (right) Inaugural Addresses.<br>
           In President Biden's Inaugural Address the most common two words together are “we can” used<br>
           a total of fifteen times together. The most commonly used two words together from President<br>
           Washington’s Inaugural Address is “of the” used a total of 20 times. From looking at these two<br>
           images it can be clearly seen that both sets of text are related in some sort of way as both show<br>
           one seeming to take responsibility for their country.<p>

        <img src="pics/washington3.png" alt="Word blob of Washington's address" width="600" height="300"/>
        <h4> Biden (top) Washington (bottom)<h4>
        <p>Between both of these texts the tone is quite the same as the inaugural address of President<br>
           Washington projects the hope of a new nation rising, President Biden’s projects the hope of<br>
           the same same nation rising again in the midst of a pandemic. President Washington’s address<br>
           is a very patriotic speech as President Biden’s is full of hope. Both Inaugural addresses show<br>
           the hope for the advancement of the United States under the watch of both presidents.<p>
