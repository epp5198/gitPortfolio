        <p>For my Game Analysis the game I had chosen from itch.io was Alluvium developed by Powerhoof. Alluvium is a very simple looking game that is extremely captivating as you take control of Ian Forrester, a civil engineer stranded in West Papua. As Ian, you endure many different challenges while attempting to find a way off of the island.</p>
