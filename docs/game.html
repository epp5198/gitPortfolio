        <p>For my Game Analysis the game I had chosen from itch.io was Alluvium developed by Powerhoof. Alluvium is a very simple looking game that is extremely captivating as you take control of Ian Forrester, a civil engineer stranded in West Papua. As Ian, you endure many different challenges while attempting to find a way off of the island.</p><br/>

        <p>While playing through Alluvium you will come across three main locations and two sub locations. As the game starts you find Ian (yourself) stranded on a beach with a singular tent, the first location ‘Camp’. As you complete the first few tasks in hope to be seen by a passing ship Ian loses consciousness causing the screen to go dark. Ian wakes up in the second location ‘The Ship’. ‘The Ship’ is the least prevalent of the three main locations in the sense of time spent there, however without this quick change of scene you could not complete the game. The events that take place on the ship lead Ian to wash up on the same beach he was stranded before, distraught as freedom was so close. It is upon arriving at ‘The Camp’ one again that the third of the main locations is unlocked ‘Old Camp’. Here you see mutilated corpses of others who were stranded along with Ian creating many more questions from the player and making the game even more intriguing.</p>

        <p>The first of the two sub locations is ‘The Fuselage’ (the main body of a plane), this location is used as a doorway from ‘The Camp’ to the ‘Old Camp’. The second sub location is the ‘Dam Wall’, this location is briefly used for the very end of the game.</p>
